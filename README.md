MyBlog is my own project. I believe sharing knowledge and keeping memories of your day to day life is precious. To accommodate both the things a self created blogging website is a best deal.

<b>Current status of project development</b>

This project is in the planning stage and i am about to start development soon.
Requirement gathering and designing part is done and next is to implement and integrate to make this project live.

<b>Target audience</b>

Target audience would be regular blogger. It would be good for people who want to share their knowledge and thoughts for betterment of other freely.
For now, i am the only target audience for this project. I am building this for my interest.

<b>Market Potential and expected popularity</b>

As this is an open source project the market potential for it makes no sense. There are no financial motivations behind building this project. The main motivation is experimentation and developing a world class piece of MEAN stack based blog engine. 
On the flip side the popularity of this project is expected to be huge. As it is a javascript full stack application, the responsive UI and fast performance will attract many readers/bloggers towards it.
